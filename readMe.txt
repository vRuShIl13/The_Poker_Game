THe Poker Game
==============

A game of gamble
A human player plays against the cpu (the cpu is of 2 types 1. dumb 2. professional)

Amazing graphic display of the table and the cards. Amazing project to work on.

Note: To change the cpu type to and fro dumbAI and WhizzAI:
	1. Go to the GameLogic.java file
	2. in the GameLogic constructor, to enable WhizzAi, uncomment the WhizzAI and comment DumbAI and vice verca for DumbAI.

*note 2*
=> i Have also provided the images folder that contains the png file of the card facing down.
