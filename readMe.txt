THe Poker Game
==============

A game of gamble
A human player plays against the cpu (the cpu is of 2 types 1. dumb 2. professional)

Amazing graphic display of the table and the cards. Amazing project to work on.

How to run JUnitTests: 

 * i have provided the jar file in my zipped folder
 => To run the tests, first compile the JUnitTests.java file using the command "javac -cp .:junit-platform-console-standalone-1.6.0.jar JUnitTests.java"
 => Then run the tests using the command "java -jar junit-platform-console-standalone-1.6.0.jar --class-path . --scan-class-path"

Note: To change the cpu type to and fro dumbAI and WhizzAI:
	1. Go to the GameLogic.java file
	2. in the GameLogic constructor, to enable WhizzAi, uncomment the WhizzAI and comment DumbAI and vice verca for DumbAI.

*note 2*
=> i Have also provided the images folder that contains the png file of the card facing down.

//Just in-case//saving time. compiling files.
javac Cardable.java Card.java Deckable.java Deck.java GameLogicable.java GameLogic.java Handable.java Hand.java PokerGame.java PokerTableDisplay.java
 TestableHand.java DumbAI.java WhizzAI.java
